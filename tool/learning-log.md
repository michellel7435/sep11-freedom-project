# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **AnimeJs**

## Project: **X**

---

### 09/30/2024:
* Many types of animation code and specific targets such as properties, values, and many more.
* What I did to learn about my tool was reading the animejs website for information of those animation codes
* I tried to test it out on JsBin but the code did not work and I tried to put the script in and it still didnt work
So all I did for this was to learn about the code and try to think of the connection with this tool to my freedom project and how I would use it.
* Next time I will ask for help and try to start trying out the code.
