# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **AnimeJs**

## Project: **X**

---

### 09/30/2024:
* Many types of animation code and specific targets such as properties, values, and many more.
* What I did to learn about my tool was reading the animejs website for information of those animation codes
* I tried to test it out on JsBin but the code did not work and I tried to put the script in and it still didnt work
So all I did for this was to learn about the code and try to think of the connection with this tool to my freedom project and how I would use it.
* Next time I will ask for help and try to start trying out the code.

### 10/27/24:
* What I did was I tried tinkering my tool in my IDE because it dodnt work in jsbin
* I tested out some of those codes in the animejs website to get a better understanding of the codes
* I change the codes up a little to make it my own and see if it works and it did.
* I also watched videos on my tool to help me out as well.
