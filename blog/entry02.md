## Content
During the time period I've been learning more about my tool and how it would fit into my freedom project. I watched many videos on how to work with animejs and trying to get an better interpretation on how I can use some animation from animejs and make it into something, like an animated character. I was learning mostly on my tool by watching videos such as [AnimeJS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WogfLKQHi1A) where I learned more about my tool and the [AnimeJS website](https://animejs.com)

## Skills: 

#### Attention to detail
This skill I was able to learn because when coding there will be so many mistakes made. What I tend to do is pay attention to every code I typed and try to remember the code if I know it is wrong so when I run a preview of my code and something doesnâ€™t work, I already have an idea of what went wrong. TIme to time there would be a lot of typos in my work so I double check everything and go through it slowly so I can know what I did wrong and look for the mistake. This was able to benefit me because it allowed me to have less typos and mistakes and gives me more time to comprehend things.

#### How To Google
For this step I had to learn how to google because when I found my tool "AnimeJs" I had to research it which includes searching on google. I had to learn how to google because if I do I can search for the right information that I need easily instead of constantly googling it over and over again trying to look for what I need. Learning how to google can benefit the freedom to spend more time personalizing the learning experience, and less time managing it. Also if I know tools such as "command" + "f" which allows me to search for specific information using keywords. That can help me save time instead of going through all the information that is on the website.
