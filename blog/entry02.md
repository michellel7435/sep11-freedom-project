## Content
During the time period I've been learning more about my tool and how it would fit into my freedom project. I watched many videos on how to work with animejs and trying to get an better interpretation on how I can use some animation from animejs and make it into something, like an animated character.

## Skills: 

#### Attention to detail
This skill I was able to learn because when coding there will be so many mistakes made. What I tend to do is pay attention to every code I typed and try to remember the code if I know it is wrong so when I run a preview of my code and something doesnâ€™t work, I already have an idea of what went wrong. TIme to time there would be a lot of typos in my work so I double check everything and go through it slowly so I can know what I did wrong and look for the mistake. This was able to benefit me because it allowed me to have less typos and mistakes and gives me more time to comprehend things.
