## Content
During the time period I've been learning more about my tool and how it would fit into my freedom project. I watched many videos on how to work with animejs and trying to get an better interpretation on how I can use some animation from animejs and make it into something, like an animated character. I was learning mostly on my tool by watching videos such as [AnimeJS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WogfLKQHi1A) where I learned more about my tool and the [AnimeJS website](https://animejs.com). I was trying to focus on how the animation would work and how it could work such as seeing if this tool can make a piano key with the feature such as disappearing on click.


#### Tinkering 1:
For this tinker I was trying to see morphing of a shape to another. I wanted to see if its possible to make a piano game using morphing because it was the closest thing I could've gotten AnimeJS to relate with.

The code above was an AnimeJS animation where the square would morph into a circle. What I didn't get was why didn't the square move while changing into a cicrle. I was able to figure out how to move it to the left because I was missing a CSS code.

#### Tinkering 2:
I also have trying to the basic of aimation and adding more code within the line.
First: I needed to add my own CSS and my own HTML setup.

Second: This allowed my animation of the circle can show in my server when I code the animation down.

That would give me the circle and I was trying to target my animation as well.

I added a translation to my circle which would make it translate to the right by 250

I also tried adding more circles (3) by adding more html such as `div class="circle"></div>` three times so three circles can pop up in my server. I also added a margin to my css so my circle wouldn't be together.

I added a delay to the circle so they all don't go at the same time. As well with the delay I added a start time so there is a time on when the circle can start moving.                               
![PNG image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36549d83-366f-4288-b255-ddbe8778899e)                                           
This would take the circle a little longer to start and have a delay.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)                                                  
I am currently on the EDP step 3-4 where the process is brainstorming and planning.

## Skills: 

#### Attention to detail
This skill I was able to learn because when coding there will be so many mistakes made. What I tend to do is pay attention to every code I typed and try to remember the code if I know it is wrong so when I run a preview of my code and something doesnâ€™t work, I already have an idea of what went wrong. TIme to time there would be a lot of typos in my work so I double check everything and go through it slowly so I can know what I did wrong and look for the mistake. This was able to benefit me because it allowed me to have less typos and mistakes and gives me more time to comprehend things.

#### How To Google
For this step I had to learn how to google because when I found my tool "AnimeJs" I had to research it which includes searching on google. I had to learn how to google because if I do I can search for the right information that I need easily instead of constantly googling it over and over again trying to look for what I need. Learning how to google can benefit the freedom to spend more time personalizing the learning experience, and less time managing it. Also if I know tools such as "command" + "f" which allows me to search for specific information using keywords. That can help me save time instead of going through all the information that is on the website.
