## Context: 
For my year long project, me and my partners ( Simran and Nancy ) had chosen to make a game about rythym such as a game like the piano where you have a song and you have to click on the keys on time. The tool I chose to use was animejs because the tool was more newer and if I want to do a rythymatic game then I need to have animation within that game to make it process and look better. This tool also interested me because of the variety of codes or animation it provides, there was a lot options that would be able to help me make this game.What makes me interested in choosing this game is that music captives me and I feel like this game can help captives others interests as well. This would be a more complicated rhythm game since there are 3 people with 3 different tool, so what we would be doing is making questions that you have to answer on beat/rhythm such as how you click on the piano keys and so on.

## Content:
I've been using my tool for 2-3 weeks now and tinkering with it such as using the examples on [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/documentation/#cssSelector) and coding it onto JSBin to get an idea of my tool and trying to undertsnad on how to use it. I also had been watching videos on my tool to go more advance such as watching a video on [SVG Path, Morphing, Line Drawing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAKYW_1f-dw&t=482s) which can help me if I want to create or form shapes to my liking. Another video I watched was a basic [AnimeJs Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRDLFXxihgc) which helped me develop an idea of animejs and how to use it properly. 

Tinker:
On JSBin i've been reading through 

```js
    <div class="dom-node-demo">
      <div class="el"></div>"
    </div>
<script>
      var elements = document.querySelectorAll('.dom-node-demo .el');

      anime({
        targets: elements,
        translateX: 270
});
</script>
```
