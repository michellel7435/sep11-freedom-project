## Topic:
For my year long project, me and my partners (Simran and Nancy) had chosen to make a game about rythym such as a game like the piano where you have a song and you have to click on the keys on time. The tool I chose to use was animejs because the tool was more newer and if I want to do a rythymatic game then I need to have animation within that game to make it process and look better. What makes me interested in choosing this game is that music captives me and I feel like this game can help captives others interests as well.
